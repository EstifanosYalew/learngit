Introduction to Node.js

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser, 
enabling the creation of server-side applications. 

Web Page:
 A web page is typically written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and can contain text, images, multimedia, and links to other web pages, 
 viewed in a web browser,
 primarily designed to display information in a visually meaningful way.

Web Application: A software program that requires an internet connection to function, 
utilizing data stored on remote servers (e.g., Facebook, Gmail).

Static Web Page: 
An HTML document with fixed content that does not change unless manually updated. 
It is served directly by the web server to the browser upon request.

Dynamic Web Page: 
A page that generates content dynamically based on user input or other variables, 
often involving server-side scripts that modify the HTML before sending it to the browser.

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): The protocol used for transferring web pages on the internet, 
facilitating communication between a client (browser) and a server. 

Event Loop: 
A core component of Node.js that allows it to handle multiple concurrent operations without blocking,
enabling efficient processing of requests.

NPM (Node Package Manager): 
A package manager for JavaScript that helps developers manage and share open-source packages for Node.js applications.
